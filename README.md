# Healthcare Data Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on a healthcare dataset containing **55,000+ patient records**. The objective is to analyze patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital admissions, and billing patterns to generate meaningful insights.

The project demonstrates a **complete data analytics workflow using Python and Power BI**, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and interactive dashboard development.

## Data Cleaning Steps

The dataset was preprocessed using Python:

* Standardized text formatting for names and categorical values
* Converted admission and discharge dates to datetime format
* Created hospital stay duration feature
* Created age group categories for demographic analysis
* Segmented billing amounts into categories
* Checked for missing values and inconsistencies

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive insights into healthcare data.

### Key Metrics

* Total Patients
* Average Billing Amount
* Average Hospital Stay Duration

### Visualizations Included

* Patient distribution by gender
* Age group analysis
* Most common medical conditions
* Admission type distribution
* Billing amount by medical condition
* Insurance provider analysis
* Hospital performance analysis
* Patient stay duration analysis

### Interactive Features

* Dashboard navigation buttons
* Reset filter button
* Dynamic slicers
* Interactive charts
